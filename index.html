Computers are intended to help people solve problems, from weaving cloth, to doing complex 
calculations for the Army during WWII, to helping man fly to the moon and back. They are an amazingly useful tool.<br>
But, they're also as dumb as a pile of rocks. By themselves, they only take up space. Friends of mine have referred
to them as 'boat anchors' or 'door stops.' By themselves, they are just expensive collections of metal, plastic, and silicon.
If that's all they are, how do they do all of the things they do?<br>
The answer is programming. Somewhere, a programmer wrote a program (or a bunch of programs) 
to tell the computer what to do. As a programmer, your job is to take a problem, break it down into a series of steps, and 
describe those steps to the computer so it can arrive at a solution to the problem.
